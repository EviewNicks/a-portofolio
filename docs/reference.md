I appreciate your clarification and the example provided. The design style you are describing aligns closely with "parallax scrolling," a modern web technique where different layers or elements on a page move at varying speeds as the user scrolls, creating an illusion of depth (z-scroll or 3D effects) and dimensionality. This can be combined with horizontal scrolling (x-scroll, where content shifts sideways instead of vertically) and enhanced vertical scrolling (y-scroll) for non-linear, immersive experiences. Parallax often incorporates smooth animations, 3D transformations via CSS or WebGL, and minimalist aesthetics to maintain focus on content without overwhelming the user. It is particularly popular in 2025 for storytelling, portfolios, and interactive sites, emphasizing engagement through subtle motion rather than flat, linear layouts.

To assist with your project guidelines, I have compiled a selection of relevant website examples from recent compilations. These prioritize minimalist designs and incorporate parallax with x-scroll, y-scroll variations, and z-scroll/3D effects. I focused on sites that demonstrate smooth, non-linear scrolling for inspiration. Each includes a brief description of its implementation:

- Hokaido: A minimalist site with a dark, subtle background and floating cards. It uses horizontal parallax (x-scroll) for sideways motion on scroll, combined with smooth floating animations to enhance depth without complexity.

- Magnetic Background: Minimalist with transparent elements creating a cave-like immersion. Features pointer-based 3D parallax (z-scroll), where foreground layers move faster than the background, simulating depth interactively.

- Rotational Parallax: Playful yet minimalist design reliant on user interaction. Implements rotational 3D motion (z-scroll) triggered by the pointer, adding non-linear exploration through smooth rotations.

- Cloudz: Immersive minimalist theme with layered clouds. Employs vertical parallax (y-scroll) with varying speeds for depth, plus non-parallax animations like growing elements for a seamless, storytelling flow.

- Firewatch: Clean, text-free minimalist forest scene. Utilizes vertical parallax (y-scroll) across multiple layers, with darkening effects to build z-scroll depth illusion progressively.

- Delassus Group: Minimalist with a playful fruit motif. Incorporates horizontal parallax (x-scroll) and 3D animations for auto-scrolling elements, creating a natural, enticing non-linear path.

- Niika: Portfolio-focused minimalist layout. Features pointer-based parallax (z-scroll) with subtle 3D background shifts, ensuring smooth, depth-enhanced navigation without excess visuals.
